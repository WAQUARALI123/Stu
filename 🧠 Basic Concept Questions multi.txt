Q1.What is a thread?

A= what is Thread

A= A thread is the smallest independent unit of execution inside a program.

A= A thread is a small independent part of execution inside a program 
                                OR
A= Thread is a small independent part of our program 

2Q.difference between multitasking multiprocessing and multithreading

‚úÖ Multitasking:

1.Performing multiple tasks at the same time
2.It can involve multiple processes or multiple threads.

‚úÖ Multiprocessing:

1.When a system uses multiple processors (CPUs/cores) to execute multiple processes at the same time ‚Äî truly parallel execution.
2.Each process is independent and has its own memory.

‚úÖ Multithreading: 

1.MultiThreading is the process of running multiple thread at a same time with in a single process
2.Threads share memory and resources of the process.

Q2.what is Multithreading;

A= ‚úÖ Multithreading:

Multithreading is the process of running multiple threads (smallest units of a process) at the same time within a single process.
Threads share the same memory and resources but run independently, making the program faster, more efficient, and responsive.

üéØ Key Points to Add if Asked Further:

1.Threads are lightweight compared to processes.

2.All threads share the same memory space (heap memory) of the main process.

3.It's used when you want to perform multiple tasks at the same time ‚Äî like downloading a file while updating the UI.

In Java, you can create threads by:

Extending the Thread class

Implementing the Runnable interface


Q3.What is the difference between a thread and a process?

A= Process :
  
1.A process is an independent program that works separately and has its own memory and resources.
2.Each process has its own separate memory.
3.Communication between processes is slow and complex (needs IPC ‚Äì Inter-Process Communication).
4.Processes are heavyweight (use more resources).
5.If one process crashes, others are usually safe.

Thread :	

1.A thread is the smallest unit of execution inside a process.
2.Threads share the memory of their parent process.
3.Communication between threads is fast and easy because they share memory.
4.Threads are lightweight (use fewer resources).
5.If one thread crashes, it can affect the entire process.


what is process 

‚úÖ What is a Process (for your understanding):

A process is just a program that is running on your computer.

It has its own memory, CPU time, and resources (like files, network, etc.)
OR

A process is an independent program that runs on the Operating System (OS).

Each process has its own separate memory space and works independently from other processes.


Example:
If you open Chrome, VLC Player, and Word at the same time ‚Äì these are all separate processes. They are independent of each other.


It runs separately from other processes.

Each process is independent ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt easily share memory with others.

When you open an app like Chrome, WhatsApp, or Word, your computer starts a new process for it.


4.How do you create a thread in Java?

A=In java we can create thread by two ways

1.extends Thread class
2.implements Runnable Interface

‚úÖ In Java, the best way to create a thread is:

Implementing Runnable interface ‚úÖ

 Why is implementing Runnable better than extending Thread?

Implementing Runnable:
Why is implementing Runnable better than extending Thread?

Implementing Runnable:

"By implementing Runnable, you can extend another class as well."
"You can extend another class and still implement Runnable."

‚úÖ Meaning:

In Java, a class can implement multiple interfaces (like Runnable, Serializable, etc.)

So if you implement Runnable, you are free to extend any other class also!

		
Extending Thread:
"You can't extend any other class (Java only allows one class inheritance)."

‚úÖ Meaning:

In Java, a class can only extend one class ‚Äî not two or more.

If your class extends Thread, you cannot extend any other important class you might need later.


Q. :but i don't need to extends another class so in this case which is best for use .

‚úî Use Runnable ‚Äî it's still the better choice.

Even if you're not extending another class, Runnable is better because:

It makes your code clean and flexible.

It works well with advanced thread handling (like ExecutorService).

It's the recommended approach in Java.

‚ùå When should I use Thread directly?
Only in very simple or quick test programs ‚Äî not in real projects.

üîπ What is ExecutorService in Java?
ExecutorService is a Java interface that helps you manage and run threads in a better way.

ExecutorService is an interface in Java that provides a high-level way to manage threads.
It allows you to run tasks asynchronously using a thread pool, so you don‚Äôt need to manually create and manage threads.

What is the difference between execute() and submit()?

Q5.What are the ways to start a thread?
   what are the ways create thread ?

1.Extend the Thread class.

2.Override the run() method.

3.Create an object of the class (your custom Thread class).

4.Call the start() method to begin the execution of the thread.

_________________________________________________________________________


Q6.What is the difference between extending Thread class and implementing Runnable interface?

A=1. Extending the Thread Class:
Steps:

You extend the Thread class.

You override the run() method to define the task.

You create an object of your class (which is a Thread).

You call start() to begin the thread.


2. Implementing the Runnable Interface:
Steps:

You implement the Runnable interface.

You override the run() method to define the task.

You pass the Runnable object to a Thread object.

You call start() on the Thread object.


____________________________________________________________________________________


Q7.What is multithreading and why is it useful?

A=Multithreading is the process of running multiple threads (smallest units of a process) at the same time within a single process.
Threads share the same memory and resources but run independently, making the program faster, more efficient, and responsive.

Why is Multithreading Useful?
Improves Performance and Efficiency:

 Efficiency means:
Doing more work in less time using the same or fewer resources.

With multithreading, process of running multiple thread at a same time with in a single response 

___________________________________________________________________________

Q8.What is the lifecycle of a thread?

A=1. New State (born) // When a thread object is created using Thread t = new Thread();, it is in the new state.  

2. Runnable State (ready) // When you call start() on the thread, it moves to the Runnable state.

3. Running State (Executing) //The thread scheduler picks the thread from the Runnable pool and it  
                               //starts executing its run() method.

4.watting State (blocked)   // during running state we call method join() sleep() wait() go to  
                             waiting state. after waiting state go to runnable state. and then go  
                            to running

5.Dead (State)  // Running state fully execute after that goes to dead state.


Runnable pool mean= All threads that are ready to run but waiting for CPU time.
_______________________________________________________________________________

 
Q9.What are daemon threads?

A= üîµ Daemon Thread = a background helper thread.

It runs in the background to support normal (main) threads.

It does not do important work.

When all normal threads are finished, the JVM automatically terminates (kills) all daemon threads.

"When the main thread finishes, JVM will terminate the daemon thread."

‚úÖ You don‚Äôt need to manually stop daemon threads. JVM does it.

 What are normal (main) threads?
These are the threads that do the actual work in your program.

Example: main() method runs in the main thread (a normal/user thread).
_______________________________________________________________________________

Q10.How can you make a thread sleep for some time? 

A= Thread.sleep())
___________________________________________________________________

Q11.What is the volatile keyword?

A= Always read the latest value of a variable directly from the main memory, not from a thread's local cache.

why volatile keyword Always read the latest value of a variable directly from the main memory not local 
cache

A= In multithreading, each thread can store copies of variables in its own local cache (such as CPU registers), not always in main memory. The volatile keyword is always read from the main memory, 

Why is it needed?

In multithreading, each thread may keep a copy of a variable in its own memory (cache).

So, if one thread updates the variable, other threads may not see the change immediately.

If you mark a variable as volatile, all threads will always read the fresh/latest value from main memory.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

12.what is synchronization

A=Only one thread can access a specific block of code or method at a time is called synchronized.

13.what is not synchronization 

A=Multiple threads can access and modify the same data or execute the same block of code at the same time    
   is called not synchronized.

 "If multiple threads can access a specific block of code simultaneously, it means the code is not synchronized."


14.what is critical section  and synchronization  
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Q. what is the difference between sleep() and wait() method

Q14.Here are the most commonly asked multithreading methods in Java interviews

1.start()

2.run()

3.sleep()

4.join()

5.interrupt()

6.wait()/notify()



1.‚ùì what is start() method 

 "The start() method creates a new thread and then calls run() inside it."

The start() method is used to start a new thread.
It tells the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to create a new call stack and run the run() method in a separate thread.

‚úÖ"The start() method is used to create a new thread and internally calls the run() method in that new thread."

2.‚ùì what is run method

The run() method is the place where you write the code that should be executed by a thread.

‚úÖ"The run() method contains the code that will be executed when the thread runs."


‚ùì Why do we override the run() method in multithreading?
Because the run() method contains the code that the thread should execute.

When you create a thread, you need to tell it what to do ‚Äî and you do that by writing your code inside the run() method.

3.‚ùì what is sleep() method

 sleep(time)
Pauses the current thread for the given time (in milliseconds).

Thread.sleep(1000) pauses for 1 second.

4.‚ùì what is join() method

‚úÖ The join() method is used to pause the execution of the current thread until another thread has finished its execution.

"Note: join() pauses the main thread (or calling thread) until the other thread finishes its execution."


join() if a thread wants to wait for another thread to complete it task. then we should use join() method

5.‚ùìwhat is yield() method

Tells the current thread to pause and let other threads run. 

‚úÖ "The yield() method tells the current thread to pause and give a chance to other threads to run."


6. ‚ùì interrupt()

 Sends a signal to a thread that it should stop or pause (does not forcefully kill it).

 Usually used with sleep() or long-running loops.

 
7. ‚ùì isAlive()
   Checks if a thread is still running or has finished

 8. ‚ùì setDaemon(true)

 Marks a thread as a daemon (background) thread.

 Daemon threads end when all non-daemon threads finish.
